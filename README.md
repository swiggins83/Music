Music!
------
A bunch of random music-related program things.

To see what we're up to, take a look at the sub-projects!

All of these projects require that you have jfugue installed.

To install with maven from the command line, first download the jfugue jar from http://www.jfugue.org
Then type ```mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/jfuguejar -DgroupId=org -DartifactId=jfugue -Dversion=4.0.3 -Dpackaging=jar```
